# tictactoe
TicTacToe game developed in JAVA. The game is played on the console and requires only one person. To compile and execute it with bash:

```javac *.java```

```java Main```

Otherwise you can simply open it with IntelliJ and execute the main function (anything newer than Java 7 should be fine).
## How to Play

Choose your symbol: Type 'X' or 'O' (X always goes first as per official rules)

Make your move:

Enter the row number (1 to 3)

Enter the column number (1 to 3)

Winning rules: Align your symbols on a complete row, column, or diagonal

Game end: The game ends when a player wins or when the board is full (draw)

After the board is full, you will be asked if you want to continue to play or not, just type 'y' to restart
